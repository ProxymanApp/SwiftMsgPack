## What's this?

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization format, which lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON, except that it's [faster and smaller](http://theburningmonk.com/2011/12/performance-test-binary-serializers-part-ii). Small integers are encoded into a single byte while typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.  
You can read more about [specs directly from the main web](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md) site.  
Moreover it's made in pure Swift, no dependencies, lightweight & fully portable

## How to use: one-shot pack & unpack

Both serialization and deseralization happens inside a `Data` object.

In order to pack one or more objects you need to create an empty `Data` instance and call `pack` by passing the object(s) you want to serialize.
It's pretty easy, take a look here:

```swift
var data = Data()
do {
  let obj1 = "Hello World"
  let obj2 = 45.5
  let obj3: [AnyHashable:Any?] = [ "key_1" : "value test","key_2" : 4,"key_3" : true, otherHashableKey: "value1"]
  // Now you can pack your instances by passing them to pack function
  try data.pack(obj1,obj2,obj3)
} catch {
  print("Something went wrong while packing data: \(error)")
}
```

Deserializing data is pretty simple too, just call `unpack` function to an instance of `Data` with msgpack data:

```swift
let data: Data = // msgpack data...
do {
  let decodedObj: Any? = try data.unpack()
} catch {
  print("Something went wrong while unpacking data: \(error)")
}
```

## Supported Types

SwiftMsgPack supports the following Swift types:
- `String`
- `Data`
- `Bool`
- `nil`
- Numeric values: `Int` & `UInt` (`UInt8`,`Int8`,`UInt16`,`Int16`,`UInt32`,`Int32`,`UInt64`,`Int64`), `Float` and `Double`
- `Dictionaries` (`[AnyHashable:Any?]`)
- `Array` (`[Any?]`)

The following limitations are specified by [MsgPack specs format](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#types-limitation):

* a value of an Integer object is limited from `-(2^63)` upto `(2^64)-1`
* maximum length of a Binary object is `(2^32)-1`
* maximum byte size of a String object is `(2^32)-1`
* String objects may contain invalid byte sequence and the behavior of a deserializer depends on the actual implementation when it received invalid byte sequence
    * Deserializers should provide functionality to get the original byte array so that applications can decide how to handle the object
* maximum number of elements of an Array object is `(2^32)-1`
* maximum number of key-value associations of a Map object is `(2^32)-1`
